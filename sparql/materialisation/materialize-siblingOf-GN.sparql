# Insert inferred sibling relationships
# Two people are siblings if they share at least one parent
# This includes both full siblings (two parents) and half-siblings (one parent)
# Note: halfSiblingOf is a subproperty that further refines this relationship

INSERT {

#    ?person2 :siblingOf ?person1 . # uncomment if symmetric property is not properly inferred
}
WHERE {
    ?parent :parentOf ?person1 .
    ?parent :parentOf ?person2 .
    FILTER(?person1 != ?person2)  # Prevent self-relationships
#    FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?person1 :siblingOf ?person2 }  # uncomment for idempotency (incremental updates)
